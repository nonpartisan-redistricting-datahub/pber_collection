    "North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical \"noise\" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.\n",

    "In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the RDH checked which counties contained key words that would indicate sorting was required and found that the 2022 list of counties that needed sorting was down to 46 from 51.
